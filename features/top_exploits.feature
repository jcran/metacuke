Feature: Check for Known Exploits
	In order to prevent exploitation on default systems
	As an administrator
	I want to check systems for known exploits

  Scenario: 	Check ms08_067 on default systems
    Given I have a list of default systems
		When I run the windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi module
		Then I should have 0 sessions
	
	Scenario: 	Check ms10_061 on default system
		Given I have a list of default systems
		When I run the exploit/windows/smb/ms10_061_spoolss module against the default systems
		Then I should have 0 sessions
